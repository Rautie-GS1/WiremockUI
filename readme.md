# Wiremock UI

Is a project done in `.NET Framework 4.5` that creates mock servers using the famous `Wiremock` (http://wiremock.org).

The tool is completely visual and features of Wiremock have been enhanced:

* Easy to create and run a server Wiremock
* Create and manage more than one server Wiremock in one place
* Create multiple scenarios for the same API or website with the intention of switching them as needed.
* Viewing the maps with your corresponding answer in the form of`TreeView`
* Manage maps from Wiremock with the options: _create_, _Edit_, _Remove_, _duplicate_, _disable_ and _visualization in the form of JSON_
* Advanced text editor with the following options:
  * Highlight for the languages: `JSON` / `XML` / `HTML` / `JavaScript` / `C#` / `PHP` / `LUA` /`VB.NET`
  * JSON and XML formatters
  * AutoWrap
  * Search and replacement
  * Go to line
* The management of maps (inside the tool) dispenses with the restart of the server.
* Logs in text and table views with the options:
  * Analysis of time
  * Re-run the request with the internal tool`Web Request`
  * Compare requests that did not match with any `TreeView` map.
* Built-in tools:
  * `Web Request`: Is a simple executor of HTTP calls that can help debug
  * `Text Compare`: Is a simple text comparer
  * `Text editor`: Text Editor with formatting options to JSON or XML
  * `JSON Viewer`: JSON Viewer in the form of a tree.

## <a name="create-server" />Creating a mock server

When creating a new server, a scenario will also be created, you can have more than one scenario for a same server, switching them as needed using the option `Set as Default` that exists in the options of the scenarios.

* Click with the right side of the mouse over the item `Servers` and click`Add Server`
* The `Server Port` field will be automatically generated, but you can change it at any time.
* You do not need to fill in the `Target URL` field, because the idea is to create a server from scratch. If you want to generate an initial mass with an existing API, use this field and run the server in write mode `Start and Record` .

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/editor-edit-value-window.png)

## Starting the server

* Click with the right mouse button on the desired server
* Click`Start`

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/start-server.png)
* To start the server, a window containing the logs in the form of text and table are displayed.
* The first text of the "log" displays the command line (in green) that would be the equivalent to the Java command for the selected option.
* One of the advantages of using WiremockUI is that you can edit the map files and your responses without the need to restart the service.

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/server-started.png)

**Open the server in the browser**

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/open-server-in-browser.png)

## <a name="log" />Logs/Debugging

* The log of the grid is more complete than the log in text form, in addition to showing the a more easy, there's still some debug options, such as:
  * Re-run the requests.
  * Compare the requests with the existing maps.
* These debug options only work with `LISTENER` type, `NET.IN` and types `NET.OUT` are low level calls made by wiremock and that are also displayed here.

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/log-grid.png)

### <a name="reexecute-request" />Re-run requests

* By clicking with the right button on the `LISTENER` type, click the `Open in WebRequest` option.
* The tool allows you to edit the request data and displays in the status bar the return code with the time that the call took. This tool is also available through the menu`Tools -> Web Request`

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/log-grid-webrequest.png)

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/log-grid-webrequest-window.png)

### <a name="compare-request" />Compare requests with existing maps

* By clicking with the right button on the `LISTENER` type, click the `Compare` option.
* On the left side will open the contents of the log. Select the file you want to compare by using the button with the downward arrow on the right side of the comparator.
* This tool is also available in the menu`Tools -> Text Compare`

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/log-grid-compare.png)

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/log-grid-compare-window.png)

### <a name="compare-time" />Check the time of a request

* To have a higher accuracy over time, compare the time `NET.IN` type (column `RequestTime` ) with the `NET.OUT` type (column `ResponseTime` ) of the desired URL. Unfortunately, there is no option needs to get this information, it would be a desire for the next versions of Wiremock (in Java).
* The `NET.OUT` type does not return the URL in the field waited, therefore, the location of this line must be manual, i.e. clean the logs and make the call only the URL that you want to measure the time.
* This option only makes sense when this running as a proxy, it makes no sense to measure the time a mock server.

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/log-grid-time.png)

## <a name="create-server-recording" />Creating a server to write mode

Add a new server by filling out the option `Target URL` , so the execution options and recording will appear in the Server menu.

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/add-server-record.png)

**Starting the server**

When running in record mode, you will see the log `match-headers` Options, this means that when generating a map of the route, the headers `Content-Type` and `SOAPAction` should be part of the filter if any, i.e. `URL` , `BODY` and these `headers` must be the same to be an answer.

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/start-server-record.png)

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/server-started-record.png)
* After recording, the maps are displayed in the tree and your answers will be available by clicking on `+` each map.
* To use the saved files, stop the server with the option `Stop` and start with the option `Start` .

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/server-recorded-files.png)

## <a name="start-as-proxy" />Creating a server just as a proxy

Add a new server by filling out the option `Target URL` , so the execution options and recording will appear in the Server menu.

![](https://github.com/juniorgasparotto/WiremockUI/blob/master/doc/img/add-server-proxy.png)

**Starting the server**

* Click with the right side of the mouse on the server
* Click the option`Start (Only Proxy)`

# <a name="wiremock" />Wiremock-Overview

Is a project built in java that simulates a web service. Technically it was designed to work in two ways:

* **Standalone Mode**: is when it is run from the command prompt with the purpose of creating web servers storing the request and responses in the form of files. It can work with 3 types of servers.
  * Run as mock server
  * Execute as a proxy, but recording the data (useful for initial load)
  * Run only as a proxy
* **Testing Framework**: is out of our scope, but it can also be used as mock framework API to Java unit tests. In .NET we have `mock4net` that has inspired Wiremock.

For more information, visit the official website of the tool: http://wiremock.org/

## <a name="wiremock-start-as-mock" />Run as mock server

Within the context of tests it is useful to simulate APIs or anything about the HTTP protocol. The server uses, basically, of two folders to work:

* **mappings**: this folder contains the files `.json` , where each file represents a route with your respective answer. There is a lot of settings within each map, all are available in the documentation of the wiremock.
* **__ files**: in this folder are the answer files that are configured on a map.

**Example of map-GET**

This map creates a route that will be hearing the `http://[SERVER]:5500/user/all` route using the verb `GET` . When a request is within these rules the contents of the file `response.txt` will be returned:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "url": "/user/all",
    "method": "GET"
  },
  "response": {
    "status": 200,
    "bodyFileName": "response.txt",
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
  }
}
```

**Example of map-POST**

This map creates a route that will be hearing the `http://[SERVER]:5500/user/insert”all` route using the verb `POST` and when the body of the request is the same `{\"Name\":\"User3\",\"Age\":100}` . When a request is within these rules the contents of the file `response.txt` will be returned:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "url": "/user/insert",
    "method": "POST",
    "bodyPatterns" : [
      {
        "equalToJson" : "{\"Name\":\"User3\",\"Age\":100}"
      }
    ]
  },
  "response": {
    "status": 200,
    "bodyFileName": "response.txt",
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

The answer is always "raw", without any encapsulation. As in earlier maps, we saw that the response is a file `application/json` , then that file will have the JSON content, if it was an image, this answer file would have the image extension, example: `response.jpg` and your content would be a binary.

```json
{
  "key1": "value"
}
```

**Testing:**

* Up the server
  * `java -jar "D:\wm\wiremock-standalone-2.8.0.jar" --port 5500 --root-dir "D:\wm\server1" --verbose`
* GET scenario:
  * **Url**:`http://localhost:5500/user/all`
  * **Method**:`GET`
* POST scenario:
  * **Url**:`http://localhost:5500/user/insert`
  * **Method**:`POST`
  * **Body**:`{ "Name": "User3", "Age": 100}`

## <a name="wiremock-start-as-record" />Execute as a proxy, but recording the data

It is very useful to load the first mass, after that, you can edit the generated files and can create several scenarios. To use the generated files need to change the form of execution for mock server.

**Testing:**

* Up the server in write mode:
  * `java -jar "D:\wm\wiremock-standalone-2.8.0.jar" --port 5502 --proxy-all "https://www.w3schools.com/" --record-mappings --root-dir "D:\wm\server2" --verbose --match-headers Content-Type`
* Open the URL in your browser:`http://localhost:5502`
* Stop the server
* Edit any file
* Restart the server in order to use the saved files
  * `java -jar "D:\wm\wiremock-standalone-2.8.0.jar" --port 5502 --root-dir "D:\wm\server2" --verbose`
* Clear the browser cache
* Rerun:`http://localhost:5502`

## <a name="wiremock-start-as-proxy" />Run only as a proxy

In our context, it can be useful when you need to use the original service without having to change the URL in the client.

**Running:**

* Up the server in proxy mode (ignoring the maps saved):
  * `java -jar "D:\wm\wiremock-standalone-2.8.0.jar" --port 5502 --proxy-all "https://www.w3schools.com/" --verbose`
* Open the URL in your browser:`http://localhost:5502`

# <a name="wiremock-how-work" />How does it work?

The `.JAR` of Wiremock does not run using processes. The `.JAR` last version of Wiremock was converted to .NET using the "IKVM". With this, it was possible to increase the use of the tool, having direct access to the main classes.

* It uses Windows Forms as a paradigm, so you need to have the .NET Framework 4.5 installed.
* All saved files will be saved in a folder named `.app` which is at the root of where's the `.exe` .

# <a name="how-to-contribute" />How to contribute

At the moment, I will not add new features due to lack of time, I will be available only for bugs and minor improvements. If you want to contribute with new ideas or fixes, just contact us or access the board of the project.

1. I see that the main point of improvement would be in the form "FormMaster". He's in a lot of lines and little componentised.
2. Another important point is to improve the persistence layer, at the moment, the calls are not centered leaving the dangerous situation for future improvements and this aggravates by being on a database in the form of a single file.
